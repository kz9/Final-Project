    &emsp;The following report is generally built based on **the U.S. Cancer Statistics** from 1999 to
    2015, collecting information about all available diagnosed cancer cases and deaths for the whole
    U.S. population. This U.S. Cancer Statistics(_USCS_) is collected by Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention(_CDC_).
    </p>
    <p>
    &emsp;To investigate more possible tendencies and factors behind cancer, we sorted and separated the
    whole dataset into smaller data groups by **ages, areas, and cancer sites, etc**. By the several
    visual representations built, our primary goal is to help the general public who is interested
    in cancer statistics or _suspicious_ about their own health condition.
