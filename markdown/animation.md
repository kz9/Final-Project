By selecting **Rate** of your choice, this scatter chart enables you to visually
see how _age adjusted rates_, _crude rates_, and _cancer patient population_ vary, and compare the
two based on a **state** level. Also, if you click the **Play** button on the scatter chart, you
will see an animation show relationship between **rate and cancer population**.
You can also select your _year range bar_ to observe how year differences produce effects.
